<h2 id="started">📌 About </h2>

This project is a Landing Page for a restaurant, created as part of my front-end development learning journey.
I was inspired by Larissa Kich's amazing tutorial, available in video on her Youtube's channel, where she teaches how to build a modern and responsive landing page step-by-step.

While the structure closely follows the tutorial, my main goal was to practice and strengthen key front-end skills, including HTML, CSS, and responsive design principles.
